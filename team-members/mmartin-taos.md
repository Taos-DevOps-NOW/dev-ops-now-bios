I started my journey with computers back when I was 14. I purchased a laptop with my own money and went on to building my own server using Windows Server 2008 (gross I know). I was always interested in the components of a computer and how they all worked together. It pushed me in the direction of freelancing as a web designer, doing small computer repair, and eventually a "real" IT job as a system administrator for a small MSP. I branched out my skills there, teaching myself how to script with Powershell and Python and utilize all things "The Cloud". Eventually, my wife and I decided to move back to my home state Montana and I took a new job as an Infrastructure Engineer. Utilizing more DevOps toolsets and teaching a team on Agile methods to improve the time of delivery and improve the quality of the product. 

I love to read, learn new things, spend time outside, and I always have things going on with my family of two kids and my wife. I love to help, even when I don't know something. If I find something that I don't know. I make it a priority to learn it. I am happy that I now have found Taos and look forward to improving and growing with the team.
