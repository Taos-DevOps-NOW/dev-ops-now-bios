I started working on computers when I was 14 years old and have never stopped. I grew up in Alaska and I'm the oldest of 4 and I'm now married and have three kids of my own. My wife and I met in the Marine Corps where I served as a Data Systems and Network Specialist and we are both Combat Veterans.

In my spare time I'm either spending what little time I have left in the evening with my family or playing video games when the kids go to bed. My wife is a stay-at-home Mom so I'm pretty dedicated to working and learning as much as I can to progress my career.

I taught myself Powershell and have worked with Taos for the last two years in the Onboarding Department, creating and improving Powershell automation for on/offboards. Most of my time with Onboarding was spent as an agent but most recently I worked as the Onboarding Lead. I've developed a 2D game in Unity using C++ and published it online.

I'm ecstatic to work as a DevOps Engineer and work with all of you!
