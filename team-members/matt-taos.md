I never thought that getting invited over to play a video game on a PC for the first time when I was around 11 would spark a career and interest in computers for life. 

I have been working from the bottom like most. Help desk to jr admin to Sys Admin to now DevOps. My passion orignated in PC hardware then to Networking, from there Linux became a passion mixed with the cloud. Working with Programming languages to get things automated and built has been great fun and allows for a bit of laziness in the workplace.

When I am not sitting at a desk I am hanging out with my family.My wonderful wife and I have 4 beautiful children. We enjoy doing a little of everything. And love doing a bit of DIY. We think it is important to serve others and are always looking for those opportunites.
