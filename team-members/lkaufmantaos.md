I grew up around my older brother who was constantly getting into trouble for taking apart computers he shouldn't have, so I learned pretty quickly from his mistakes; meaning that I got caught less. I got into IT as a career after moving to Boise, and have avidly been trying to learn more and find more technical positions to challenge me since then. I still view myself as a newbie at most things, but am a fast learner. My first introduction to automation was my job as a call center supervisor. I had gotten tired of all the mindless paperwork thats foisted upon the average supervisor everyday, so I wrote a few lines of AppleScript to make them do themselves. After that every lead in my department was asking me to do stuff and I was hooked. 

I've spent the last few years assisting the Taos Onboarding team by writing and maintaining their automation repository, mostly comprised of Powershell. Im completely self taught, so I'm sure I'll have a few bad habits that I'm open to correcting should someone notice them. 

When away from work, I love playing video games with my roommate or hiking the foothills and mountains. I enjoy brewing my own mead, wine, and hard kombucha.
