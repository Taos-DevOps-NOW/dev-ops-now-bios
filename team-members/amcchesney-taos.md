I am a developer who is constantly looking for the next optimization. 
From a young age I always knew that development was going to be my career but thought it was 
going to be in the form of my favorite hobby, video game development. After C++ classes in 
high school I soon graduated to teaching myself c# for development in the popular unity 
game engine. After putting my skills to use in my primary job I found that solving complex 
business problems was just as satisfying as rendering pixels. Soon after I found myself working in 
a large corporation acting as software architect for the internal cloud computing platform.
Using a functional flare I write in my favorite language Powershell when available, 
with my primary language being python, and the capability to wield (begrudgingly) 
javascript when the circumstances demand (where are you web assembly!).

Outside of working hours my free time usually I can be found spending time pushing myself 
to the next level. Physical training usually consists of a trip to the gym or indoor rock 
climbing, while the mental game is strengthened pondering philosphy (currently with a focus 
on the zen teachings of Alan Watts) or reading a good book.
