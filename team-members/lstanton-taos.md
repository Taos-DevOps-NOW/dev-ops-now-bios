================

I wasn't born a computer geek, I actually studied fiber arts in college. I was bored and unfulfilled doing administrative work, so I learned programming at night and was thrilled to start a new career as a software engineer. It's an unconventional path, but both disciplines have creative and analytical aspects, so it made sense for me. I still get to solve interesting problems and make things. I spent the first five years of my tech career designing and writing business applications in C#. Now I'm working on the DevOps now team, and I wonâ€™t be bored again anytime soon.

When I'm not at the keyboard, I like to make art, grow plants, and identify wildflowers. I'm a Louisiana native who lives in Idaho with my husband, two cats, and a flock of chickens.
