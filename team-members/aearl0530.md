I am currently calling myself a DevOps engineer. I found that most fitting as I am melding 
Development and Operational things more than ever these days. Our team is helping companies 
develop, revamp, troubleshoot, implement, and transition things like cicd pipelines, 
infrastructure as code, cloud platform architecture, security awareness, and applications.


I've always gravitated to improving and streamlining and automating processes and repetitive tasks 
starting back at a local computer chip manufacturing company almost 20 years ago where I 
implemented and improved the assembly line belt flow for outgoing packages. I moved on to 
many other lines of work but usually grew board with them. About 10 years ago I had a chance 
to do some contract work for a small local company mapping the office ports and installing 
new switches and rewiring the patch-panels in the data room. From there I realized that the 
potential to improve things was only beginning. 


Through the years I came to love Bash as I automated many operational tasks with it as an 
Engineer on an SRE team managing all parts that make up a functioning website. However, 
Python now has been my go to for small or larger projects with its versatility and structure. 
I'll never forget you bashâ€¦ 


My wife and I are Boise natives and when we have free time we really enjoy getting outside 
with our three kids, and when at all possible doing things like snowboarding, hiking, and camping.
