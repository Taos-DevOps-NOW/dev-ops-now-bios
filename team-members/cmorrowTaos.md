My name is Carissa Morrow, mom of two dog children, and lover of all things programming. 
Prior to graduating a three month intensive bootcamp as a full stack developer and joining 
the Taos Devops team as a Cloud Support Engineer I was a Certified Ophthalmic Technician. 
I assisted in many different types of surgeries such as Blepharoplasties and Ectropion 
repairs which I absolutely loved, but when I realized I had hit my peak as the resident 
expert I figured it was time to move on and make my programming passion a career. 
I'm proud to say I've built a handful of sites that friends and family continue to use to 
post travel adventures and keep track of their to-do's. I would say my favorite languages are 
Python and C# and Vue.js for the frontend. I'm extremely thankful I chose the DevOps path 
because every day and every client brings something new. I can honestly say I will never be 
bored in this field.
