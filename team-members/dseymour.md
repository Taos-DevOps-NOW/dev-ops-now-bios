If I had to describe myself, I'd be the guy who packs up containers. The software ones, not the PODS kind.

It all started a long time ago in a support team far, far away, specifically Google's Cloud Platform support. I quickly rose to become to the team's SME on all things Docker, Kubernetes, and GKE. From there, I decided that support wasn't for me and made the jump into professional services where I've worked on delivery of large-scale GCP Terraform environments and helping companies automate different aspects of their Kubernetes deployments and infrastructure.

My day-to-day life consists of using the right number of gifs, listening to podcasts, and playing the occasional round of golf.
