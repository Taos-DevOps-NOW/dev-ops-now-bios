     ================
   
   
    My first professional software job was in 1996 working for  an aerospace company in Malvern, PA; a suburb of Philadelphia. I was responsible for writing build and deployment scripts that supported 8 different flavors of UNIX. After a few years I decided to post my resume on DICE and was contacted by a company in San ## Diego. The offer was too good to pass up, so I relocated from Philadelphia to San Diego in 2000.

Most of my career I have worked as a .NET developer but moved into DevOps in 2015. I was working on some in house tools to handle remote deployments, so when my company at the time was looking for developers to join their newly created DevOps team, I was tapped to handle automation since I was already working in that space. 

Devops allows me to touch a lot of products, and help make peopleâ€™s lives easier. Devops helps companies reduce cost and error, and you can see a much faster return on investment that traditional application development. I like being able to see how everything fits together. 

In my spare time I like spending time with my wife and daughter, and still enjoy skateboarding and punk rock. I run a punk rock record label on the side.
