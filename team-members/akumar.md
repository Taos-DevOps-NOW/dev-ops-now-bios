Avneesh Kumar
========================

I have started the beautiful journey in the software industry a long time ago and continuing it happily afterwards. After finishing my under graduation, i did a six months training in one of the biggest MNC company in India which provided me the encouragement, knowledge, motivation to keep learning new technologies and make my affirmation stronger towards the quotes that continuous learning is the key to success and change is the only constant in the world.
 
I moved to this magnificent country Canada three years before to pursue my masters in software engineering. Every moment, be it learning core concepts of software industry , working on cross- cutting technologies or to embrace the extravagant landscapes of canada, every moment was exciting for me.

I am happy to accept this new role of DevOps Engineer and looking forward to work with bright minds.
