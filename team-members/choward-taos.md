## Cody Howard

Hi, I'm Cody.

I am a native Southerner, father of two; lucky enough to have a wife who puts up with me. The Florida State University is my Alma Mater; I graduated with a dual degree in Political Science & International Affairs, focused in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. German was my language of choice.

I am dedicated to doing the best work possible; frequently, I fall into the trap of allowing great to be the enemy of good.

As a consequence of this determination, on occasion, I have been described as `aggressive` regarding work.

However, the perceived aggression is, instead, determination being made manifest. **More importantly, if we enter a situation; you begin to feel friction, please say something.**

I am a loyalist and believe deeply in being **direct, open, and honest.** My life has been an aggregation of informal relationships and `making ${it} work`. In my last role, my direct report told another individual:

> I've never seen Cody not solve a problem.

He was telling the truth; I was incredibly happy to hear about such a positive statement - however, it was also an incredible trap. Tl;dr - you never know when you're going to develop another complex.

Prior to having a son, I planned to join the military as a path into participating in greater international operations on behalf of the United States. But, my life was dramatically altered upon my son's arrival; that was the end of the military.

I spent roughly four years trying to make a living with social science degrees before I decided it was time for a change. Thereafter, I spent roughly six months studying everything I could get my hands on that had anything to do with programming, operations, and development. My first role was contracting with the FBI and state LEO organizations to provide a myriad of services.

Afterwards, I spent about two and a half years as a systems engineer with an Edge Computing firm. If you'd like to know more about that, I'd be happy to discuss it with you. Altogether, I am incredibly grateful to have worked for such a company, as I learned many very hard lessons very quickly.

If you'd like to know more about my skillset, I'd be happy to have a conversation with you about it as well.

Now I have arrived here and am extremely happy to have made it.

Every day isn't always a good day, but, it is almost always an interesting day.

### Fun Facts

- I have survived more than 20 car crashes; two of which I was ejected from the vehicle. During one of these, I literally broke my skull.
- Somehow I managed to survive hitting a Great Oak at about 85mph in an championship winning SCCA car ( no harness, but it was there ). I was a passenger; the driver lived too, but he broke the windshield with his face.
- For the vast majority of my youth ( following said skull fracture ) I was a kickboxer; unfortunately, prior to my first ranked fight I destroyed my knee while literally kicking somebody in the face.
- I belong to a family of career shooters and military service. The most common family activity, these days, is shooting sporting clays.
- During college I was lucky enough to have the time to build a handful of different cars, most of which were subsequently totaled.
- Prior to the pandemic, I was training to enter the USPSA - but, y'know, 2020 was quite the year.
