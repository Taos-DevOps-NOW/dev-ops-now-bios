# Mukesh Sharma

My name is Mukesh Sharma and I am working as DevOps Engineer II in DON project. I started off 15 years ago as a systems engineer and was responsible for entire office IT starting from servers to deployed applications on them. Learning on the job and investing my personal time in educating myself across multiple technologies gave me lots of good opportunities to learn on the job. Furthermore, built multiple custom end to end applications which are still being used in the production environments at eith client environments or the organization I used to work at.

I am a powerlifter and have been lifting for quite sometime. I am also a big fan of supersports bikes and own one myself. In my downtime, I like to take a stroll in countryside and spend time with my family.
