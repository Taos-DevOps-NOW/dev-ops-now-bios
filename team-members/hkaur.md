=============================

I have always been great with Programming, started off with Java in my high school and since then I have been coding and learning tons of different tools and hope to learn a dozen more with Taos. I prefer a huge list of tools in my resume(LOL). 
Personaly, I love to live with or atleast stay close to my family. Other than work, I try to look for ways to find time for myself as well, I love to sketch(faces), watch movies and read books (especially documentaries). I moved to Canada one-two years back from India and since then lockdown/snow have disrupted my travel plans but hopefully soon I would start my travel plans. 

I have been a teacher to my younger brother since childhood, which I believe is one of my talents(being a good mentor) which maybe one day I ll put to a better use. One of my dream is doing social work especially for the under priviledged kids.
