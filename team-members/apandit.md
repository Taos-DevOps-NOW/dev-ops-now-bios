I have always been attracted to puzzles and problem-solving questions, I feel they not only test my logical ability but also my creativity.
Creating an application is similar to a puzzle, it is this passion which driven me to take Applied Computing course at the University of Windsor.
I have been exposed to many fundamentals courses and each subject added to my repository of knowledge immensely. Also, I got specifically inclined towards Java programming.

I moved to Canada in 2016 to pursue my degree at the University of Windsor and later got an opportunity to work for Indellient as a software developer,
where I used to work on back-end coding and got exposure to the DevOps field. I got to learn various CI/CD tools and cloud technologies which excited me
to take this opportunity in Taos as a DevOps engineer.

I am very much connected to my family and friends back in India and make sure to meet them once a year. I  also have a great
passion for cooking and trying out various cuisine. In my past time, I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, and going for a walk.
I am friendly and fun-loving by nature and people can reach out to me with their concerns.
